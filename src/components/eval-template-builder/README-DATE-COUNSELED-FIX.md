# Date Counseled Field Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the "Date Counseled" field in the evaluation template builder.

## Problem

The "Date Counseled" field was not functioning properly due to naming inconsistencies between the frontend and backend:

1. The frontend used camelCase (`dateCounseled`)
2. The backend expected snake_case (`date_counseled`)
3. The data wasn't being properly normalized between these formats

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `counseling-info-section.tsx`

- Added more robust logging to track the value changes
- Improved the `getDateValue()` function to better handle both naming formats
- Enhanced the change handlers to ensure consistent data format

### 2. Updated `useTemplateCommandInfo.ts`

- Added detailed logging to track data flow
- Improved normalization logic to handle both camelCase and snake_case formats
- Ensured consistent field naming in the state management

### 3. Created Data Transformation Utilities

- Added a new file `utils/data-transformers.ts` with functions to transform data between frontend and backend formats
- Implemented functions to handle both individual fields and complete template data

### 4. Updated `useTemplateDataOperations.ts`

- Modified the save function to ensure data is properly formatted for the backend
- Added both camelCase and snake_case versions of fields to ensure compatibility
- Added logging to track data transformations

## Testing the Fix

To test that the fix is working properly:

1. Open the evaluation template builder
2. Enable advanced options
3. Set a date in the "Date Counseled" field
4. Save the template
5. Reload the page and load the saved template
6. Verify that the "Date Counseled" field displays the correct date

## Technical Details

The fix addresses both the UI rendering and data persistence issues:

- **UI Rendering**: The component now properly handles both naming conventions when displaying data
- **Data Persistence**: When saving to the database, both naming formats are included to ensure compatibility
- **Data Normalization**: Consistent normalization is applied throughout the data flow

## Future Improvements

For a more comprehensive solution, consider:

1. Standardizing on a single naming convention throughout the application
2. Adding a data transformation layer at the API boundary
3. Updating the database schema to use consistent field naming
