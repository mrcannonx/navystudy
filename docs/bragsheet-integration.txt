I'll regenerate the Navy Evaluation Template Builder with the additional features you've requested.

I've redesigned the Navy Evaluation Template Builder to include all the requested features. Here's what's been added:

### 1. Brag Sheet Integration
- Added a dedicated "Brag Sheet" panel on the right sidebar
- Displays year-round accomplishment entries with dates, descriptions, and metrics
- Each entry shows relevant achievements that can be added directly to the evaluation
- One-click transfer of brag sheet entries to the appropriate evaluation section
- Visual indication of which entries have already been added

### 2. AI-Powered Enhancement
- New AI Enhancement panel on the left sidebar
- Shows examples of weak statements and their improved versions
- Highlights the type of enhancement applied (metrics added, stronger verbs, etc.)
- "Analyze Current Section" button to request AI analysis of the current draft
- Quick access "Enhance with AI" button in the main editor

### 3. Custom Metrics Library
- Streamlined metrics panel on the right sidebar
- Organized by evaluation section (displays metrics relevant to current section)
- Search functionality to quickly find appropriate metrics
- One-click addition of metrics to evaluation text
- Option to create custom metrics for personal use

### 4. Improved UI Organization
- Feature toggle buttons at the top to show/hide each tool as needed
- Responsive layout that works on various screen sizes
- Color-coding for different features (blue for metrics, purple for AI, green for brag sheet)
- Maintained the core evaluation editor with tabs for editing, preview, and guidance

Each of these features is designed to work together seamlessly, helping sailors transform their year-round accomplishments into powerful, quantifiable evaluation statements with appropriate Navy terminology and metrics.

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of the updated design in more detail?
