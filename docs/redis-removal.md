# Redis Removal Documentation

This document explains the changes made to remove Redis from the application.

## Overview

The application previously used Upstash Redis for:
1. Rate limiting AI requests
2. Caching summarizer results (though this wasn't actively used)

These functionalities have been replaced with in-memory alternatives that provide similar capabilities without requiring an external Redis service.

## Changes Made

### 1. In-Memory Rate Limiter

Created a new rate limiter implementation that stores rate limit data in memory:
- `src/lib/rate-limiter/memory-rate-limiter.ts`: Implements rate limiting using a Map to store request counts
- `src/lib/rate-limiter/memory-client.ts`: Provides a compatible interface to replace the Redis client

### 2. Updated AI Security Middleware

Modified the AI security middleware to use the in-memory rate limiter:
- `src/lib/middleware/ai-security.ts`: Now imports from memory-client instead of Redis client

### 3. In-Memory Summarizer Cache

Created an in-memory implementation of the summarizer cache:
- `src/lib/cache/memory-summarizer-cache.ts`: Implements caching using Maps to store summaries and progress data

### 4. Removed Redis Dependency

Removed the Redis dependency from package.json:
- Removed `@upstash/redis` from dependencies

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Deployment**: No need to set up and maintain a Redis instance
2. **Reduced Costs**: No external service costs for Redis
3. **Simplified Configuration**: No need for Redis connection strings and authentication

## Limitations

1. **No Persistence**: In-memory storage is lost when the server restarts
2. **No Distribution**: Rate limits and cache are not shared across multiple server instances
3. **Memory Usage**: Heavy usage could increase memory consumption

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are no longer required:
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

## Future Considerations

If the application scales to multiple instances, consider:
1. Implementing a distributed rate limiting solution
2. Using a shared cache service
3. Reintroducing Redis or another distributed cache/rate limiting solution

## Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure:
1. Rate limiting still works correctly
2. The summarizer functionality works without Redis
3. The application starts without Redis-related errors
