# Redis Removal Documentation

Redis has been completely removed from the application. The following changes were made:

1. Removed Redis client and dependencies
2. Replaced Redis-based caching with in-memory alternatives
3. Removed Redis environment variables:
   - UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL
   - UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN

Note: If scaling to multiple instances is needed in the future, consider implementing a distributed caching solution.
