Based on my exploration, I now have a good understanding of the RankStudy application. It appears to be a comprehensive study and career development tool for Navy sailors, with several key features:

1. Flashcards and Quiz system for study
2. FMS (Fleet Management System) Calculator
3. Eval Template Builder for performance evaluations
4. Summarizer tool
5. Various other calculators (PMA, Award Points)

Now I can suggest additional study tools and addon features that would complement this application and maximize its educational value for sailors.
